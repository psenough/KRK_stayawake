EU regulations force speaker manufacturers to switch the speakers off after 30 mins playing sounds below -50dB.

Sometimes i want to play things below -50dB for longer periods of time.

This page plays a 10hz tone for 20 seconds every 25 minutes - you can't hear the 10hz tone and it's signal is enough to keep the speakers on.

You need to press play manually once - web browser regulations require audio scripts to have a user interaction before producing sound.
